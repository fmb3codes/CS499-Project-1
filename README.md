 This application is intended to take in either a P3 or P6 .ppm file and similarly write it out to a P3 or P6 .ppm format.

 There are no special notes regarding the usage of the program; the program can be built from the makefile and commands should be sent
according to the usage pattern given in the project criteria. The program assumes that a properly formatted P3 or P6 input file
should be passed to the command line and that it should also exist, but there is error checking in the case that it doesn't. Also, if
the output file specified does not exist, then one will be created. Also included two example ppm files for reference of formats P3 and P6 respectively (identical image) which I've tested writing to all formats.
